- use `final` more consistently (IDEA setting?)
- rename `BarcodeInventory`.
- split `BarcodeInventory` into smaller classes: separate finding barcodes from responding to finding a barcode.
- introduce abstractions for System.out? print action?
- wrap lookup table in domain class.
- introduce a value type for prices to replace `int`.
- use Vavr `Stream` library in order to turn `takeWhile... not` into `takeUntil`, which @jbrains finds easier to read.
